This is the readme for the Number Guesser program.\
My solution to (https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) found on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).\
My project URL: https://github.com/I-M20/Cpp-projects/tree/NumberGuessing 

The program uses **cstdlib** and **ctime** libraries in order to generate a random number from 1 - 100.
It has three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium and Hard) which gives the user less attempts than the former level to guess the random number respectively.
In order to run it, you can use an IDE of your choosing.\
**Requirements**\
In order to compile this program, you need the following compilers or any of your choosing
- GCC: Version 7.1 and higher
- Clang: Version 5.0 and higher
- MSVC: Version 2017 and higher
  
If you prefer a different compiler, make sure it's upto date to avoid compiling issues and follow compiling instructions included in the compiler's documentation.
##
To compile, open the terminal and navigate to the directory the file is in and type in the following:
- GCC: g++ -o numberguesser numberguesser.c++
- Clangg: clangg++ -o numberguesser numberguesser.c++
- MSVC: use the previous two commands depending on which compiler you have installed.
##
When the program has been compiled, run it by typing

.\numberguesser.exe
